abstract: The low-energy limit of several string theories feature what is known as the axiverse, i.e. a plethora of light axions with masses spanning various orders of magnitude. Within the simplest picture, the masses of the resulting axions depend on two parameters: a hard non-perturbative scale $\mu$ (which in turn is related to the supersymmetry breaking scale $M_{\rm susy}$), and the dimensionless instanton action $S$ responsible for breaking the axion shift symmetry and generating the axion potential. In this work, we explore whether these two parameters can be probed using cosmology. Considering for definiteness the case where the axion is present during inflation, we perform a series of Bayesian inference analyses taking into account current limits on the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the primordial isocurvature fraction, and measurements of the dark matter energy density today. Adopting string-inspired flat priors on $\log_{10}M_{\rm susy}$ and $S$, and imposing that $M_{\rm susy}$ be sub-Planckian, we find $S=198 \pm 28$ at 68\% confidence level (C.L.), in striking agreement with the theoretical expectation that $S \approx 200$, whereas $M_{\rm susy}$ remains unconstrained. We find that these bounds imply $\log_{10}\(m_a/{\rm eV}\) = -21.5^{+1.3}_{-2.3}$ at 68\%~C.L., with $m_a$ the axion mass, suggesting that cosmological data complemented with string-inspired priors select a quite narrow axion mass range within the axiverse. We find that $M_{\rm susy}$ remains unconstrained due to a fundamental parameter degeneracy with $S$. We therefore explore the impact of fixing $S=198$ and $S=153$, respectively the inferred mean and 2$\sigma$ lower limit of $S$. In the former case we find $\log_{10}\(M_{\rm susy}/{\rm TeV}\) = 7.8^{+1.4}_{-2.4}$ at 68\%~C.L., while in the latter case we find $M_{\rm susy} \lesssim 8 \times 10^3\,{\rm TeV}$ at 95\%~C.L., which could lead to potentially interesting signatures at the proposed 100 TeV collider. For consistency, we perform a final analysis where we do not impose string-inspired priors, but flat priors on $\log_{10}m_a$ and $\log_{10}f_a$, with $f_a$ the axion decay scale. In this case we find $\log_{10} (m_a/{\rm eV}) = -11.1^{+11.5}_{-5.9}$ and $\log_{10}(f_a/M_{\rm Pl}) = -5.5^{+1.7}_{-3.1}$ at 68\% C.L. (with $M_{\rm Pl}$ the reduced Planck mass), thus mildly disfavoring the ultra-light axion region, but consistent with the value of $m_a$ inferred by Klaer and Moore assuming that the axion makes up all the dark matter. This result differs from that of our first string-inspired analysis because imposing that the supersymmetry breaking scale lie below the Planck scale leads to a preference for lower axion masses, in agreement with theoretical results.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: We consider a quintessence field which transitions from a matter-like to a cosmological constant behaviour between recombination and the present time. We aim at easing the tension in the measurement of the present Hubble rate, and we assess the $\Lambda$CDM model properly enlarged to include our quintessence field against cosmological observations. The model does not address the scope we proposed. This result allows us to exclude a class of quintessential models as a solution to the tension in the Hubble constant measurements.
