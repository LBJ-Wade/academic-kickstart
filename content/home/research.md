    My research interests lie broadly at the intersection of cosmology, astrophysics, and particle physics. I work at the interface of  data analysis, theory, phenomenology, and experiments. My goal, through precision cosmological and astrophysical data, is: to identify those models which best describe our Universe, and in particular its dark components - dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE); to constrain the parameters of these models and define goals for future experiments; and likewise to construct viable data-driven theoretical models. This back-and-forth interplay between existing data, future experiments, and theory, represents my main research strength.
