I am a post-doctoral researcher at Gravitation, AstroParticles Physics Amsterdam (GRAPPA). I also hold a "Fellini" Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellowship at the National Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN) in Frascati (Italy), starting 2021. I was previously a postdoc at NORDITA and Stockholm University, and a graduate student at The University of Utah.

My research activity spans various interesting topics including particle astrophysics, dark matter, dark energy, and black holes. I have focused in exploring the role the axion as a dark matter candidate, for which I co-wrote a review on Physics Report in 2020.
