Last year (June 2020), there has been a lot of excitement and speculation around the [excess](https://cerncourier.com/a/researchers-grapple-with-xenon1t-excess/) reported by the [XENON-1T collaboration](http://www.xenon1t.org), which could be attributed to new physics such as the [axion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion). I recently worked on the bold idea that a specific model of dark energy could have caused such an excess. My work with [Sunny Vagnozzi](https://www.sunnyvagnozzi.com/blog/welcome), [Philippe Brax](https://phbrax.wixsite.com/brax), [Anne-Christine Davis](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/person/ad107), and [Jeremy Sakstein](http://www.jeremysakstein.com) is available on ArXiv [at this link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15834). More excitingly, the model would be in reach of future experiments such as [XENON-nT](https://science.purdue.edu/xenon1t/?tag=xenonnt) and [PandaX](https://pandax.sjtu.edu.cn).

The preprint has recently received attention from Space.com, which has covered the article in a popular science blog which is available at  <https://www.space.com/dark-energy-experiments-on-earth>

The research article by the XENON-1T collaboration on the reported excess can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.09721).
