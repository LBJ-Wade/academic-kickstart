A recent press coverage by [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk) has focused on my work on black holes <https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08077>.

In the press coverage [available here](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/2021/se/scientists-find-black-holes-could-reach-stupendously-large-sizes.html) my collaborator [Bernard Carr](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/spa/people/emeritus-staff/profiles/bjcarr.html) of Queen Mary discusses in depth the outcome of our study and future projects. The paper has been recently published on [*Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society* **501** (2) 2029–2043 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staa3651).
