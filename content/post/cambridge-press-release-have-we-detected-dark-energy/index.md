My recently paper with [Sunny Vagnozzi](https://www.sunnyvagnozzi.com/blog/welcome), [Philippe Brax](https://phbrax.wixsite.com/brax), [Anne-Christine Davis](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/person/ad107), and [Jeremy Sakstein ](http://www.jeremysakstein.com)on the bold idea that a model of dark energy could be responsible for the [excess](https://cerncourier.com/a/researchers-grapple-with-xenon1t-excess/) reported by the [XENON-1T collaboration](http://www.xenon1t.org) is now published on [Physical Review D](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.063023). The arXiv preprint is available [at this link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15834). 

Our work has been covered by a press release of the University of Cambridge (home of Dr. Vagnozzi and Prof. Davis), which is found [at this link](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/have-we-detected-dark-energy-cambridge-scientists-say-its-a-possibility?fbclid=IwAR1ghM91ysIm7EGa2vDOC7I2nSGL32f7ewB1PSJ_QGB91g6hIO8Z-1x2R3s).

More on the work is in [my previous entry here](https://lucavisinelli.com/post/can-we-detect-dark-energy-in-the-lab/).
