In two recent preprints ([](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05377)[2011.11649](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11649), [2009.14218](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14218)), together with Aliki Litsa, Katherine Freese, Evangelos Sfakianakis, & Patrick Stengel, we discuss non-Gaussianity arising in the reheating process when the Higgs field modulates inflaton decay. This process is expected to arise even within a minimal Standard Model + inflaton setup and can be readily tested with upcoming probes, as we discuss at length in the preprints. This important work has been covered in great detail in [https://www.sunnyvagnozzi.com/blog/top-arxiv-week-48]([https://www.sunnyvagnozzi.com/blog/top-arxiv-week-48](https://www.sunnyvagnozzi.com/blog/top-arxiv-week-48-2020))
