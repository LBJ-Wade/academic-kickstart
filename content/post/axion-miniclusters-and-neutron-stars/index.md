In two recent preprints available here ([2011.05377](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05377), [2011.05378](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.05378)), I have shown together with my colleagues Bradley Kavanagh, Thomas Edwards, and Christoph Weniger, that an encounter between a neutron star and an axion *minicluster* would lead to a transient radio signal in the sky, which is potentially detectable. It took us 15 months to deliver the required code, which is available at <https://github.com/bradkav/axion-miniclusters/>. This immense work has been covered in great detail here: [https://www.sunnyvagnozzi.com/blog/top-arxiv-week-46](https://www.sunnyvagnozzi.com/blog/top-arxiv-week-46-2020)
