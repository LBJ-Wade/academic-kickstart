A black hole is a region of spacetime from which no particles or even electromagnetic radiation can escape, because of the strong gravitational field. Black holes are astrophysical objects that can be formed through various scenarios, for example they are the ultimate fate of extremely massive stars. I am working on the shadow of spinning black hole and on the interplay between dark matter and black holes.
