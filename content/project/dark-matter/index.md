Dark matter is an hypothetical form of matter that makes up a large fraction of the mass in the Universe. The existence of dark matter is inferred through its gravitational interaction with ordinary "baryonic" matter and light, and it is essential in driving gas and dust to build up into stars and galaxies. I work on the phenomenology of dark matter models like the weakly interacting massive particle and the axion.
