title: Probing the Early Universe with Axion Physics
abstract: Axions and axion-like particles are excellent dark matter candidates,
  spanning a vast range of mass scales from the milli- and micro-eV for the QCD
  axion, to 10−22 eV for ultralight axions, to even lighter candidates that make
  up the “axiverse”. In some scenarios, inhomogeneities in the axion density
  lead to the formation of compact structures known as axion “miniclusters” and
  axion stars. Topological defects in the early universe might also contribute
  the energy density of axions and generate primordial gravitational waves that
  can possibly be detected in future experiments. I will first discuss
  astrophysical and cosmological constraints on axions at either end of this
  spectrum, using data from the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and the
  effects of miniclusters on the gravitational microlensing and on direct
  detection. I will then assess the formation and the evolution of axion stars
  in various astrophysical regimes.
