title: Direct detection experiments and dark energy
abstract: We explore the prospects for direct detection of dark energy by
  current and upcoming terrestrial dark matter direct detection experiments. If
  dark energy is driven by a new light degree of freedom coupled to matter and
  photons, then dark energy quanta are produced in the sun and free-stream
  towards earth where they can interact with Standard Model particles in the
  detection chambers of direct detection experiments, presenting the possibility
  that these experiments could be used to test dark energy. The strong
  constraints that typically result from stellar probes of new light particles
  are evaded in screened dark energy model, in which the production in the core
  of the Sun, and similarly in the cores of red giant, horizontal branch and
  white dwarf stars is suppressed. As an example, we examine whether the
  electron recoil excess recently reported by the XENON1T collaboration can be
  explained by chameleon-screened dark energy and find that such a model is
  preferred over the background-only hypothesis at the 2.0 Ïƒ level, in a large
  range of parameter space not excluded by stellar (or other) probes. This
  raises the tantalizing possibility that XENON1T may have achieved the first
  direct detection of dark energy. Finally, we study the prospects for
  confirming this scenario using planned future detectors such as XENONnT,
  PandaX-4T, and LUX-ZEPLIN.

I have attended the 2021 edition of the [Cosmology from Home](https://www.cosmologyfromhome.com) series, with the talk "Direct detection experiments and dark energy" covering my work available [at this link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15834). See [my dedicated blog entry](https://lucavisinelli.com/post/can-we-detect-dark-energy-in-the-lab/) for a thorough description of the project. My talk is now available [at this YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTEmga0OFyg).
