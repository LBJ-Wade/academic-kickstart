title: Recent and future developments in dark matter axion physics
abstract: The study of compact objects such as black holes and boson stars is an
  important component of modern astrophysics and particle physics. My talk will
  focus on two complementary aspects of the interplay between dark matter and
  compact objects. I will first discuss some indirect signatures that can be
  searched from bound structures formed of the QCD axion, a popular dark matter
  candidate. I will then focus on what we can learn on the properties of dark
  matter, light fields, and the structure of space-time from the observation of
  black hole phenomena like superradiance and VLBI interferometry.
