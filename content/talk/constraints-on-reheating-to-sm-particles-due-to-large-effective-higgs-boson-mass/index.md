title: Constraints on Reheating to SM Particles due to Large Effective Higgs
  Boson Mass
abstract: >
  An early period of inflation driven by a rolling scalar field must end by
  successfully reheating the Universe into the radiation-dominated era before
  the time of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. In my talk I consider inflaton decays
  (both perturbative and resonant) into SM particles, which acquire their mass
  via couplings to the SM Higgs boson. The particular decays may temporarily be
  blocked due to the light spectator Higgs field obtaining a large effective VEV
  from quantum fluctuations during inflation. In the first part of the talk I
  will present a method of calculating the adiabatic density fluctuations that
  arise because the Universe exhibits a space-dependent reheat temperature, 

  due to the correspondingly space-dependent Higgs-induced particle masses. These fluctuations are severely non-Gaussian due to the inherent non-linearity of the reheating process. Results for the non-Gaussianity parameter f_NL are presented in the second part of my talk. Finally, I will show how temperature fluctuations and non-Gaussianity together can provide significantly strong constrains on SM parameters based on Cosmic Microwave Background measurements by Planck.
