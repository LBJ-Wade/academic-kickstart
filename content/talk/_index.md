title: "Axion Miniclusters: Tidal Disruption and Radioastronomy"
abstract: Axions and axion-like particles are excellent dark matter candidates,
  spanning a vast range of mass scales from the milli- and micro-eV for the QCD
  axion, to 10^(-22)eV for ultralight axions that make up the "axiverse". In
  some scenarios, the collapse of the non-homogeneous axion field leads to the
  formation of two kind of compact structures, known as axion "miniclusters" and
  axion "stars". I will first discuss astrophysical and cosmological constraints
  on axions at either end of this spectrum, using data from the cosmic microwave
  background anisotropies and the effects of miniclusters on the gravitational
  microlensing and on direct detection. I will anticipate some work in progress
  at GRAPPA on the new branch of "axion radio-astronomy" that involves neutron
  stars and axions. I will then assess the formation and the evolution of axion
  stars in various astrophysical regimes.
